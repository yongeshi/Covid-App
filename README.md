MapCovid is an android mobile application made with Android Studio in Java. MapCovid displays COVID related news and infection rates within the Los Angeles county. It also shows nearby COVID test locations and the user’s past travel history path if locations are turned on.

App Features: <br>
The app has a loading screen, and upon first open, the app shows onboarding instructions which you can swipe through. The main page displays an interactive map of Los Angeles County, color coding specific regions to denote how many active cases of covid are in the specific region. The user will also be able to find all covid testing locations on the map as well. 
On the second page, the user has access to the most up-to-date information on COVID in the local area in the form of relevant Twitter feeds, the latest news articles, and case statistics. Case statistics include, but are not limited to, number of new cases, number of cases in the last 30 days, number of total cases, infection rate, number of daily deaths, and positivity rate. All information is based on the user’s current location. 
The app supports Geofencing. As the user travels into a new region, they would receive live updates on new covid developments in the area in the form of push notifications. Each time the user enters a new area, they will receive information about the severity of local cases. A region with importantly different COVID severity from the user’s previous location constitutes a “new area.”
As the user travels throughout the day, the app tracks their path and provide relevant COVID data based on each location the user spent time in. The app will show data for locations the user spent time in, not where the user drove through. The user will be able to examine their past paths taken to 21 days in the past. Note that this feature will only become available if the user allows the app to track his or her location while not using the app. At any point, the user can delete all information stored on them if they desire. This app is fully functional without any account registration. <br><br><br>
